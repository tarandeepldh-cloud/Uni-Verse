# UniVerse - Campus Companion

A modern, frontend-only web application for university students to manage attendance, events, and lost & found items.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Simple login system with localStorage persistence
- **Dashboard**: View attendance trends with interactive charts, upcoming events count, and lost items overview
- **Events Management**: Browse and add campus events with dates and club information
- **Lost & Found**: Report and track lost or found items across campus
- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful, mobile-friendly interface using modern CSS
- **No Backend**: Fully functional as a frontend-only application with localStorage for data persistence

```

## How It Works

### Authentication
- Users login on the index page with a username
- Username is stored in localStorage under `universe_user`
- Protected pages redirect to login if no username is found
- Logout removes the stored username and redirects to login

### Data Persistence
- **Events**: Stored in localStorage under `universe_events`
- **Lost & Found**: Stored in localStorage under `universe_lostfound`
- **Attendance Data**: Fetched from `data/marks.json` with fallback sample data
- **Reload Sample**: Button resets data to original JSON files

### Dashboard
- Displays statistics cards for attendance percentage, upcoming events, and lost items
- Uses Chart.js (CDN) to visualize attendance trends
- Automatically calculates stats from fetched data
- Falls back to sample data if JSON files are unavailable

## Getting Started

### Local Development

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open a local server (required for fetch to work):
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (with http-server)
   npx http-server
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
4. Login with any username or use "Demo User"

### GitHub Pages Deployment

1. Create a GitHub repository (or use existing one)
2. Push all files to the repository
3. Go to repository Settings → Pages
4. Select "Deploy from a branch" and choose `main` (or `master`) branch
5. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

**Note**: CORS restrictions may affect JSON fetching on GitHub Pages if served from a different domain. The application includes fallback data to handle this gracefully.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Flexbox and CSS Grid
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: No frameworks or build tools
- **Chart.js 3.9.1**: For attendance trend visualization (via CDN)
- **localStorage**: For client-side data persistence

## Features Explained

### Login Page
- Simple username-based authentication
- Two options: Enter custom username or use Demo User
- Responsive design with gradient background

### Dashboard
- **Attendance Card**: Shows average attendance percentage
- **Events Card**: Counts upcoming events
- **Lost Items Card**: Shows count of lost items
- **Attendance Chart**: Interactive line chart showing weekly attendance trends

### Events
- Add new events with title, date, and optional club name
- View all events in a card grid layout
- Reload Sample button resets to original data
- Data persists in localStorage

### Lost & Found
- Report lost or found items
- Specify location where item was lost/found
- Mark as "Lost" or "Found" with color-coded badges
- Delete items individually
- Reload Sample button resets to original data
- Data persists in localStorage

## Sample Data

The application includes sample data for all sections:
- **Attendance**: 8 weeks of attendance percentages (85-94%)
- **Events**: 5 sample campus events with dates and club affiliations
- **Lost & Found**: 5 sample items with locations and types

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: Full support
- IE11: Not supported (uses modern ES6 features)

## Notes for GitHub Pages

- All paths use relative URLs for compatibility
- Chart.js is loaded via CDN (requires internet connection)
- If JSON files cannot be fetched (CORS), fallback data is automatically used
- All data is stored locally in the browser - nothing is sent to servers

## Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `css/style.css`:
- Primary color: `#667eea` (purple)
- Accent color: `#764ba2` (dark purple)
- Text color: `#333`
- Background: `#f5f7fa`

### Adding More Sample Data
Edit the JSON files in the `data/` folder:
- `marks.json`: Add more weeks/percentages
- `events.json`: Add more events
- `lostfound.json`: Add more items

### Modifying Form Fields
Update the HTML form in respective pages and the JavaScript handlers in `js/events.js` or `js/lostfound.js`.

## Support

For issues or questions, check that:
1. You're running a local server (fetch requires http://)
2. Browser console shows no errors
3. JavaScript is enabled
4. Browser is not in private mode (may affect localStorage)
